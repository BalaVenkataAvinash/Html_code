     <h1>Introduction:-</h1>
     <p>
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam ( 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
          statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in
          Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
          scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
          Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
          military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on
          the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
          technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
          nuclear test by India in 1974.

          Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
          Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he
          returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
          of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

          While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
          apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended
          the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

     <p>
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
          centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
          father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
          housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram
          and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15]

          Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been
          wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a
          Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local
          women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from
          Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
          to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the
          1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young
          boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21]

          In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a
          strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his
          education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's
          College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954.[22]

          Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While
          Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
          threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the
          deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a
          difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed
          ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

          After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
          Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of
          India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started
          his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam
          joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and
          recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station
          (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the
          project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
          satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
          independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme
          to include more engineers.[25]


          Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
          In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center
          in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort
          to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be
          successful.

          Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
          representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also
          directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the
          technology of the successful SLV programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister
          Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under
          Kalam's directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true
          nature of these classified aerospace projects.[29] His research and educational leadership brought him great
          laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme
          under his directorship.[29] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence
          Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for
          simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[30] R
          Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission,
          named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[30]
          Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range
          ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been
          criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.

          Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election
          with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25
          July 2002, to 25 July 2007.[39]

          On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they
          would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist
          Congress Party backed his candidacy.[42][43] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam,
          Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the
          announcement of his candidature:

          I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I
          was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.[45]

          On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior
          Cabinet colleagues.[46]


          Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency
          The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with
          the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the
          count was held on 18 July.[47] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy
          victory,[48] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[49] Kalam was the third
          President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming
          the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat
          Ratna who later became the President of India.[50] He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to
          occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.

          Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities.[152][153] The Government of India honoured him with
          the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a
          scientific advisor to the Government.[154] In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat
          Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.[155]
          In 2008 Kalam was the recipient of Hoover Medal.[156] And in 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award
          from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related
          project".[157]

          In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.[158]

          Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his
          birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state government
          further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate and
          ₹500,000 (US$6,000). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to residents
          of the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of students.[159]

          On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in 2015 the CBSE set topics on his name in the CBSE expression
          series.[160]

          Prime Minister Narendra Modi ceremonially released postage stamps commemorating Kalam at DRDO Bhawan in New
          Delhi on 15 October 2015, the 84th anniversary of Kalam's birth.

          Researchers at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) had discovered a new bacterium on the filters of the
          International Space Station (ISS).
